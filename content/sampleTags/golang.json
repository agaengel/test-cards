  "description": "Go is a statically typed, compiled programming language designed at Google by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson.<br>Go is syntactically similar to C, but with memory safety, garbage collection, structural typing, and CSP-style concurrency.<br>The language is often referred to as Golang because of its domain name, golang.org, but the proper name is Go.
