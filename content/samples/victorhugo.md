A Hugo boilerplate for creating truly epic websites

This is a boilerplate for using [Hugo](/stample_tags/hugo) as a static site generator and [Webpack](/sample_tags/webpack) as your asset pipeline.

Victor Hugo setup to use PostCSS and [Babel](/sample_tags/babel) for CSS and JavaScript compiling/transpiling.
